@CieraNickole they have 5 points per question you have to mention in your answer and for ever one you say, that's a point.
@CieraNickole and I don't even remember the questions exactly. They're just anal with the scoring.
@CieraNickole it's not the questions just the scoring criteria lol
@doylenoir you right
@CieraNickole cool. Our interview questions are weird. Like the way they score them lol

@_QuintinTV I'm sure I'm not
@_QuintinTV then they're just someone who wants to use me for whatever reason. Still wouldn't say thirsty. Cuz I hate the term/concept
I don't wanna interview for the job though. I wish it was just a transfer LOL
Not gonna call someone thirsty who is genuinely trying to get to know me, whether I'm interested or not.
Hoping I get this better position.
Moving forward &gt;
Keep the nostalgia/romanticism for the past FAR away from me.
@KingFuckinGee that saying has been around for decades lmaoo
@KingFuckinGee nice guys always finished last
Cuz apparently everything is thirsty now. Like, I can't even DM a man and try to get to know him without being dubbed 'thirsty'.
When did genuinely pursuing someone become deemed as thirsty??
@RocStarNYC I guess
@p0pson thanks
@SoloDahSystem you can tell when someone is interested but not fully convinced on taking that chance. &amp; if you really want it, convince them
@SoloDahSystem I think it is. She could be a little interested and just need you to convince her why she should be fully.
@FlyoutChase &amp; persistence plays a part in that. It's not hard to tell when someone is completely uninterested vs slightly interested.
@RocStarNYC I don't even use it though
@FlyoutChase persistence can pay off. Just a risk you decide to take or not take. Nothing wrong with going after someone you want
@CoolBreezeLT I do it often
I hate that word 'thirst'. It's so stupid.
@SoloDahSystem why does it have to be thirst? Why can't they just like the person enough to put in effort? lol

Women always get off easier than men. It's bullshit
@HeelRoberson idk? Lol
&amp; honestly that sends a HUGE message about drunk driving. That's a slap on the wrist for KILLING someone.
'Well she didn't mean to &amp; I'm sure she regrets it' she made the conscious decision to drive while drunk and killed a man. Foh with regret
Honestly stunned people are defending her, FUCK THAT
Drunk driver kills man. Gets a plea deal and is sentenced to one year.... A-MAZING.

@BWyche11 I agree lol. I'm 5'5 I don't need much else
@If_ItAint_B what
@Quist_7ide exactly, there's reasons why we like the things we like lol
Tall for a man Is anything above average (5'9).
@PrinceObs over 5'10
Women wanting taller men isn't some trend that just started. &amp; not talking about Twitter honeys who troll about 6'6 men.
RT @NicDeLaHigh: @55mmbae yup 90% of CEO are males over 6'0 tall.
@NicDeLaHigh presidents too.
@Wiz_Q_LIfaa thanks love! :)
Size is intimidating. Having a taller stature is more likely to keep potential attackers/predators at bay.
@Quist_7ide oh idc about them lol they just say things for attention, I ignore the idiots
I think that preference has always been there and maybe not necessarily for the same reasons now although we do feel safer with taller men.
Because they were thought of to be strongest (the taller, the more weight/strength idea).
Since the beginning of time, women have looked more towards taller men. It used to be taller men would better be able to protect the family
@Quist_7ide no this is a beginning of time thing lol
women have always Wanted taller men. taller men were favored cuz they were viewed as the best leaders and strongest/powerful.

I was crying at the fact that was the only thing she was worried about. LOL
@BryGuy7324 trust me I know. Alaska is right up there with Yall
If the only thing stopping them from cheating is the law then I think there's bigger problems to worry about. Lol
I said prostitution should be legal to my coworker &amp; she said 'what about people's husbands who can now cheat legally?' :/

It's not a goal for me
I'm still not concerned with a wedding.
A wedding the last thing on my mind during high school. More concerned with a career path.
I love working, making my own money doing what I love to do. A life (solely) spent bring a housewife just seems rather unsatisfying.
If that's your goal, more power to you. But it just couldn't be me.
Goals of my own &gt; being a house wife. I'd never be content with that lifestyle. I need to work, accomplish things.

I wanna go do something with you. Not chill. Let's go to a coffee shop or a road trip. Show me something new
People hear 'date' nowadays and automatically think 'bf/gf'. Not Actually going on a date lol it's funny.
Whether it be a concert or a walk in the neighborhood, spending time with someone your interested in is greatness. Dates never gonna die
@Iamdecafella and you jut generalized again lmao
@Iamdecafella you ask the wrong females Lol

@Chem_Shaw @MrKeepinIt_Real right. Who cares if a baby is pretty or ugly though? It's your baby, you're gonna think it's beautiful &amp; love it
@MrKeepinIt_Real if you love your child any less cuz it doesn't fit those standards, you don't deserve to be a parent

@SjonesiProduce I deal with it
'Why is your hair like that' 'how'd you get it so curly'
'Whys it so big'
'Why don't you comb/straighten it'
My coworkers make fun of my hair everyday. Apparently they've never seen black women wear their natural hair.

How healthy your hair is &gt; texture
@TokenBlakGuy @simsimmaaa good hair should never be used to describe texture. Only how healthy it is.

@Chrisworldpeace so laying down as a sign of surrender it'll leave you alone.
@Chrisworldpeace no... Black bears are scared off easily so just make yourself look big &amp; it'll run away. Brown bears are territorial

@NBA_Debates_ i never said there was. I actually said there isn't
Totally kicking myself right now
@Blase_J I'm Bria. What's yours
@NBA_Debates_ I said putting down others when stating your preference is loseresque. Not having a preference.
@NBA_Debates_ you obviously didn't read anything I just said...
@Blase_J no speciality. Lol trying to get into weddings
@NBA_Debates_ most of the times that's how it is actually. 'I only date ____ cuz _____ people are (insert negative adjective)'
@NBA_Debates_ which is pretty loseresque
@NBA_Debates_ nothing wrong with preferences like I said. But some aren't able to state preferences without putting other groups down
@StrangeKeith hell nah
@Blase_J yep
@NBA_Debates_ it's usually followed by negativity.
You sound lame and hurt doing so.
I do find it lame however to put down other groups of people when stating your preferences. It's unnecessary
Why would I care about your preferences if I'm not even interested in you?
@Blase_J lol thanks
They have cruises to Antarctica
I wouldn't want to date anybody like that anyway. Anyone who goes out of their way to put down others isn't cool with me.
It's always the dudes I'm not even remotely interested in who go out of their way to say 'I don't date black women'.

@AnUglyNigga you'd think basics like that would be covered
@AnUglyNigga it is. But the education on them is subpar. All we're taught is 'a baby comes out of here' nothing about hygiene/upkeep
@DesireeFierce seriously. Lol it's like well that's pretty but is there any other look?
But I'm sure a beautiful, intelligent woman wouldn't want someone like that anyway. So of course he feels that way
RT @KaeVanity: which one was your mother? RT @iAmKeious: Females are either pretty OR smart. Never both.
Oh and matte lipstick.
Hate how all the make up looks that people do basically look the same. Sharp eyeliner, smokey eyes, exaggerated lashes, contouring.

@MaxxnCheese I hate when they ask why. Like look at the things you tweet. Is it shocking to think you my have rubbed someone the wrong way
@CelticsNation26 I say body counts don't matter, positive test results do lol
@MaxxnCheese it's not hard to see why they're blocked lmao
@CelticsNation26 someone could have a body count of 1 and have an STD though. Lol
@CelticsNation26 better safe than sorry lol and most people don't feel offended about it.
If be the most annoying tweeters who screenshot someone who has them blocked &amp; says 'why did they block me?' Cuz YOURE ANNOYING.
@briaatortillaa those the people who screenshot and say 'why she block me'
@CelticsNation26 so again, you don't get tested with your partners..? Lol cuz having sex with a clean person prevents STDs
^^^
@briaatortillaa exactly. Maybe you just dislike their tweets lmao
Say it with me... THIS. DICK. AINT. FREE.
Nigga you ain't shit
@CelticsNation26 you raw everyone you have sex with without getting tested with them? Lmao
@VodkaGawd like you're not better than someone because you have less sexual partners.
@VodkaGawd I understand. I hate when people act all high and mighty about it. Like man relax..
@VodkaGawd I don't try to I just ask why they feel different lol
@Its1017_ I see
@zionthenigerian @rudegalbri they prolly disagreed
@Its1017_ not sure what a thot is
@ny_stateof_mind it's just very odd to me. Lol
@rudegalbri I respect your POV, thanks for answering my questions
@VodkaGawd like sex is some nasty thing and if you do it, you're tainted lol
@VodkaGawd any* lol I just don't understand why these things are related to some people.
I'm just tryna understand folks
@AssholeFrmNY gotcha I see
@J_Worthy how did you even notice that lmao wtf.
@rudegalbri I don't see why they can't be... What does that have to do with them as a person? Lol does it make them less of a good person?
@J_Worthy what lol
@AssholeFrmNY so it would mean nothing to you basically? You just want to know for your own curiosity?
@J_Worthy lmao thanks
@rudegalbri so they could be perfect for you in every way, but you'd say nah cuz they say a number too high?
@OSAY_it_aint_so sort of. We talked about condoms
@AssholeFrmNY no. I'll ask about getting tested. Their sexual history has no effect on our current relationship otherwise
I didn't know peoe actually asked that lol
@OSAY_it_aint_so lol I'm not having a discussion. Just saying what I think
@AssholeFrmNY and despite everything else, they could be perfect for you, you'd say nah cuz they say a number too high? Lol
@OSAY_it_aint_so that's fine
@rudegalbri so you ask people their body counts during the dating stage?
@AssholeFrmNY so you ask people their body count?
@AssholeFrmNY I see
@dreaaaaaxo me too. They're past sexual partners are irrelevant when I'm with them
RT @SouthSideGAClay: @55mmbae if she's had sex with a lot of men. Society has basically dictated to us that she isn't worthy of commitment.
RT @SouthSideGAClay: @55mmbae it's difficult for a woman to be viewed as more than property to a lot of men. Even if they don't admit it.
@SouthSideGAClay true that
@_yungkuwabara I see. Lol
@AssholeFrmNY what makes someone a slut?
@rudegalbri why not?
Someone said body count is related to value. how does that make anyone worth more/less? If you're a good person, body count is irrelevant.
@SouthSideGAClay what does a body count have to do with her value? She's more than a vagina.
@_yungkuwabara what wear and tear? Lol
@kingkaiyha I'll prolly do Marley twists again in August. And after that I'll redye and straighten

@BMurphTV couldn't be me lol
RT @BMurphTV: @55mmbae most people don't even like to read, so research is a long stretch. They're cool with ppl telling em what to think..…
@IzayaTheGod male egos are very interesting
That's how old wives tales happen. Lololol
I gotta verify. Always fact checking. Even myself
People just believe everything they're told and do no research of their own. That is amazing to me
I have half my hair done. Sigh
@Durags4Eva yes?
@IzayaTheGod dudes are weird. What's funny about that lmao
Education is so key
@IzayaTheGod what's embarrassing though?
@BASSicallyB lol I see. Just a pride thing
More education than 'a baby comes out of here'.
This is why I say education about vaginas for women is so important and we do not receive it in general education. And we should
how yall let dudes who don't even know where a clit is tell YOU about YOUR vagina? Got yall thinking all kinds of craziness
@BASSicallyB but why would you care if you did? Lol why does it matter
Can I ask why DO you care about a body count (for those who do)?

@QuirkyJERK where do you get your brows done
@MattsMentions oh okay. Not nearly as interesting lmao
@QuirkyJERK @JazDntGivAFck my coworker was paying 2500 a month for her two. That's insane lol
@MattsMentions oh so a fine?

@MattsMentions is it some kind of civil dispute? Or are you a witness? Or friends of defendant?
RT @xEricG: I HOPE SOME GOOD ASS SHIT HAPPENS TO YOU TODAY, MY NIGGA.
@MattsMentions you not being held, you're holding lol
@MattsMentions first step is showing up to everything, doing whatever you need to do to get things handled community service, fines etc

@Jacti0nJ 😑
@Chan_Channnnn no I work in the jail
Hate when gang members get brought in cuz their people call NON STOP about bail info. Like damn, one person can't call &amp; Yall hold a meeting
@Jacti0nJ no
I don't think people understand that law and order isn't how the actual legal system works. Cases aren't done in 45 mins lol
'Can you give ____ my number?'

This heroin addict is 5 months pregnant and she's crying cuz we hair is matted.... What about the baby you're exposing to heroin?
@JEB1SE no reason they should be there at all. It's sickening. I work in a jail so I see pregnant drug addicts all the time 😑
@MaxxnCheese it varies per state cuz there's variations with when a baby is actually considered a human life
Women who drink or do drugs during their pregnancy should be charged. There should be laws against that
@AM_Kraiz someone's leaving lmao

Others: well that doesn't fit what I believe so shut up!!!
Yall so illogical lol
@Aggies_Very_Own because penises get hard when they're stimulated lmao
@Aggies_Very_Own yeah it's just how our bodies react to stimulation. If a girl puts a bag on her head and sucks you, you gonna get hard lol
@Aggies_Very_Own or are attracted to their rapist.
@Aggies_Very_Own no it's a natural thing that's how our bodies are. Same with people who get aroused during rape. Doesn't mean they want it
@lad3uxieme I would call him gay. But he was right
@Aggies_Very_Own yes... Your body naturally reacts to being stimulated
Your body naturally reacts to stimulation... Attraction or not
Technically what he said was true. By definition.
@lad3uxieme idc what they do. But if there isn't attraction then by definition it isn't gay lol the dude didn't lie.
@Aggies_Very_Own read my last two tweets.
But people think attraction and sexual stimulation are mutually inclusive so.
You don't have to be attracted to someone for them to stimulate your body... Lol
@Aggies_Very_Own he didn't try to justify it. He said it isn't gay unless there's attraction
RT @SeyiNoir: tbh, I wouldn't even call a man gay for getting a blowjob from another man - unless he was attracted to said man.
@SayYana_ im sure they're meaning the texture of it. That's how most base the whole idea of being natural. Natural texture lol
@lad3uxieme oh I'm sure
I leave tomorrow 😊
@lad3uxieme lmao
Sometimes I think of how well I'm doing in life and then realize how young I am and I'm like damn. I forget my age a lot
@SayYana_ color isn't natural. The hair texture still is though and that's usually what someone is referring to in regards to natural hair
@TheMvstyBook no mine
@Randality nah lol
@Randality I see

@Randality on what
@JazDntGivAFck broken how? You can prolly sell them still if they're not in too bad of shape
People seem happy with it though
@iAmTekDaMobsta oh yeah that was forever ago lol
He hasn't even done any lead roles yet. Just supporting so far.
I think he has the look. Especially after the make up. But idk how he'll do In a role like this.
@koastin_ a supernatural being that kills kids. And the group of kids who fight against IT
@BlazeTheGreat_ yes. If the first does well
@itsexpress lmao yes and I guess people find them frightening
Horror now is just all for shock value.. Just to make you jump momentarily. Not actually try to scare you.
@RedTeddd what's scary exactly
@BlazeTheGreat_ I'm less concerned with the look than I am with the vibe. IT is really eerie/creepy. Idk if he can pull that off
@itsexpress true. I loved how creepy it was. They should've used the leech scene in the movie lol
Horror movies are my favorite
I'm excited for the new IT adaptation. I loved the first.
@iAmTekDaMobsta don't think so? But could be wrong lol
@itsexpress I loved both
@DaveCapone yes and he got the role so we'll see. Could surprise me
@FuckYoLife1_87 Ive seen him in a few roles. Only one villain role and that one he was just mean. Not scary lol so I'm looking forward to IT
@QuirkyJERK it's a good movie and book series. The 2nd one comes out in September
@itsexpress cuz he isn't a sewer clown
@itsexpress it was a scary book too lmao
@QuirkyJERK seen maze runner? He played a villain there
@DaveCapone he was the bad one of the group
@DaveCapone what??
@FuckYoLife1_87 look the part. But I think bringing about that creepy vibe is gonna be a big factor.
@itsexpress exactly. It's the eeriness
@PopeQuanPaul he's not creepy lol he's more so just weird/goofy. But he did well in maze runner so maybe
@QuirkyJERK his brows are so weird lmao I guess I find him annoying more so than creepy
Tim Curry was just so perfect. http://t.co/RXLG75mKlZ
@FuckYoLife1_87 think so?
@itsexpress idk lol
@QuirkyJERK not creepy, he just weird looking.
Not sure how I feel about this. He doesn't give me that same creepy vibe as Tim Curry

Maybe not every single way. But there is some common denominator between them
People who are similar in whatever way, are the ones folks get along with so those are who their friends are.

Not gonna fly someone out who I don't actually LIKE.
Flying people out just for sex is stupid.

Times changed. 
Human nature remains the same.
It's not far fetched at all to believe that the descendants of racists are also racists &amp; participate in the same activities.
It's not some brand new activity. Black people used to 'go missing' all the time, last seen with the sheriffs department.
Why do folks find it so hard to believe the police are unjustly killing black people? It has been happening literally for decades..
Kind of wild.
All the lives who went without justice or even recognition because no one knew about it to say 'hey that's not right.'
And you know what's so crazy? These things have been happening for a long time but they're just now being brought to the forefront.

Leg restraints and or belly chains will though.
Working in corrections, I definitely know that (only) handcuffs isn't stopping someone from being a threat. Common misconception.
If you illegally arrest someone and they die in your custody, that should automatically be at the very least negligent homicide.
