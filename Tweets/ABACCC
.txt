Worst umpires alive
That is not a strike omg
@xtina_rey short fuse by umpire
Carlos really??? Wow
@NYsportsfan2015 ya I'm mostly watching the Rangers. Umpires making it unwatchable
Worst umpires I've seen in this Yankee series
Sick goal by the #Rangers
@nyknicks @jonahballow Winslow
@BronxBomberBlog every season he gets injured
RT @HerringWSJ: This sums up the Knicks's disappointment pretty well (via @TagMyJPP) http://t.co/wted9jL1v9
Houston gave that one away
3 fouls by Green on 1 play and not one of them gets called @nba LOL
Jason Terry is terrible
Winslow it is
Bullshit are you serious 4 pick
Nice inning #Yankees
@GoldGloveSS 4 doctors recommended rehab. Not surgery
Ex Knicks still in playoffs Jr, Shump, Mosgov, Ariza, Brewer, Pablo, D Lee
Nice lip sync lol
Congrats to the #Rockets
Lets go #Yankees
Cool Royals throwbacks
Had a feeling A Rod would go yard
@sinatrafan28 can't believe Cashman signed him thru next year
Watching game 1 go #NYR
Worst timing ever for a coaches interview?
The officiating gets worse every game @nba
@yankees can you stop playing Stephen Drew? When will it end
@JGPretlow please approve online poker in New York sir
That was a great series
No basket ball in hand
Unbelievable #Rockets
Better luck next year Caps
Congrats #NYRangers onto eastern conference finals
Congrats to OBJ on the Madden cover
@NeilKeefe everything Jorge says is negative
This hacka fouling is so stupid
@GreedyStripes one of Girardi's worst games
This loss is on Girardi bad managing
Why not start the 8th with Betances ?
Not a strike not close
@sorelmizzi congrats man amazing score before wsop
Robert Kraft still making excuses....
Memphis down 18 and the crowd is twice as loud as the Clippers last night

Wtf Van Gundy? Fouling makes no sense
@nicknowsky @LukeBecker_YN26 in August he would have taken him out too. You know Joe by now
Great game Big Mike 16Ks
Remember how bad Zach Randolph was on the Knicks? Lol
Refs calling this like a Warriors home game
@algwiz hopefully Cashman is gone by then
I don't get favstar people
#ClippersvsRockets
I don't like the Bulls or Cavs. Refs were awful. Absolutely terrible
@r_loy23 I know I agree but Butler got hit in the head when he shot that three
@r_loy23 refs sucked for both teams
Wow #Bulls
RT @KnicksRyda: These refs should be ashamed of themselves #NBAPlayoffs2015
Horrible refs in this Bulls Cavs game. Embarrassing

Looks like the college football top 4 will stay the same. Can't take out a 3 ranked TCU that just won by 52 or an undefeated FSU
Knicks only a game and a half in front of the 76ers.....

Martin Jacobson was the chip leader after day 1a of the main event. What a beast congrats on the win
Terrible call with jack 5 wow
The #Giants have lost every game without Jennings and Cruz
Nice missed pass interference call. More great officials
Why is this play being reviewed? to slow the game down? Its a clear touchdown
How the Jets only won by 7 points is mind boggling
Its 20-3 with 7min left and you kick a field goal? This is so embarrasing
How are you not going for this? Wtf
The Steelers with one of the worst performances in NFL history
And now the Steelers drop an INT. Couldnt possibly play any worse
This is the worst half of football i've ever seen by a team
no clue who to start in fantasy football
College OT is very dumb
#NYKvsBKN
25 seconds to rule that a touchdown? So many oblivious referees and side judges in the nfl
Horrible game so far #NYKvsDET
why is Eli Manning still in the game?
shocking to only be down 13

@mlb game 7 of the world series and the home plate umpire is terrible. Great job
Not the spot for a bunt
some crazy news stories tonight
Royal Flush for the @Royals this inning wow
don't think the college football committee have watched much Notre Dame football
the #Giants play on Monday night after a bye week. that is very odd
tough next 4 games for the #Giants
thinking back to when the Giants handed the Cardinals a win in week 2
great win @Redskins lmao
great coin toss there ref,
no reason at all for Tony Romo to be in this game. clearly injured
this is the most ridiculous football game I think I've ever watched
what are the Cowboys doing? this is foolish
a decision? obviously they are punting
why on earth would they consider bringing Romo back? that would be the dumbest move ever
any kick off at the 50 yard line should be an automatic touchback
the battle of two former Browns quarterbacks
wtf did these refs take before the game? sooo bad
awesome win @NYRangers
terrible game so far #DALvsWAS
Derek Jeter in Dallas for the game

why do the #Knicks still wear these orange jerseys?
@NFL why not put the Eagles Lions game on fox? infomercials really?
RT @JacktonyD: So #nfl logic, lets let fans watch infomercials on FOX from 1-4 when there's the eagles-lions game
FSU vs Auburn
go #Knicks
what are the #Yankees doing?
7 years and overpaying for a guy that will play 100 games a year? pretty stupid move
@marciaherold same here
Lets go #NYG
wow what a game tonight
nice win last night #Villanova
#Duke basketball
#NYK
RT @SportsCenter: Freshman phenom Jabari Parker is the 2nd Duke player EVER to start a season with 5 consecutive 20-point games.
that was a great football game last night, one play doesn't decide a game
#KCvsDEN
the #Rangers goalies are unbelievable
watching #SNF and #NYR
great win #Giants
RT @KnicksTape: Orange vs. Red jerseys is kind of confusing
lets go #Knicks

@vika7 congrats on your big win :)
@mlb needs better umpires, not replay challenges. last night was another example
@SFGiants let go guys, sweep Boston!
@Dodgers are unstoppable
RT @UrKllinMeSmalls: Only Tim McCarver could turn "the ump clearly misses a call" into "the Yankees gave them an extra out"
@mlb how about getting some better umpires instead of replay

@stephenasmith have you ever picked the heat to lose a playoff game?
shocking how bad some players are that goto WSOP every year
all basketball refs suck. i cant name a good one
@r_loy23 yes, i feel the nba has always had the worst officials. makes it tough to watch at times
@r_loy23 im not a heat hater, just a basketball fan. no heat fan should be complaining about refs
@r_loy23 i thought it was clearly off Allen, refs are always terrible every game
@r_loy23 he didnt travel, dont think it cost them the game. that out of bounds call went off Allen and they said Heat ball
@Lives2Inspire @NBA @KingJames @KDTrey5 @kobebryant @CP3 Melo should have been on this team
how can anyone take this game seriously ? with these refs
#MoForCyYoung
Great team win #Yankees
#PrayForOklahoma
