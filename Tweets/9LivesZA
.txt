@Clarisonic my skin feels softer!
Trying it out clarisonicsa #LoveClarisonic http://t.co/bTNmocE0yI
@ClarisonicSA the bristles have round tips, don't damage the skin.
@ClarisonicSA Launches end-Jan 2015 at @Stuttafords_za, from R2499. Brushheads cost around R399 and should be replaced every 3 months.
@ClarisonicSA You can use the Clarisonic to remive facial makeup as well. Not recommended to use on the eye area, though.
@ClarisonicSA The Clarisonic is a cleanser, not an exfoliator. But you might feel you don't need to exfoliate as often when using it.
@ClarisonicSA Do consult with yout doctor if you are on Roaccutane or intensive vitamin A treatments.
@ClarisonicSA not recommended for people with cystic acne, but they claim it is safe for sensitive skin, rosacea and congested skin.
@ClarisonicSA unique sonic technology. 300 motions per second moves skin for more effective cleansing.

High sugar breakfasts shoot up insulin and you'll be hungry again by 11am. #SallyAnnCreed #RealMealRevolution @WomensExpoSA
All bran high fibre 40g portion is 5 tsp sugar. 100g is 12 tsp. #SallyAnnCreed #RealMealRevolution @WomensExpoSA
40g Corn flakes = 8,5 teaspoons sugar. 100g (realistic portion) is 25 teaspoons sugar! #SallyAnnCrees #RealMealRevolution @WomensExpoSA
health breakfast with low fat yogurt, 40g granola, tbsp raisins &amp; glass orange juice = 17 teaspoons sugar. Scary! More than can of coke!
