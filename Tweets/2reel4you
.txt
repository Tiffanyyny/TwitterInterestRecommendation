I'm glad Roman won CLEAN #WWEFastLane
RT @JoshIsenberg4: YOUR CALLS @WRESTLEZONEcom WITH @TheJoeOmega AND @FManzo3 IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING #WWEFASTLANE TONIGHT!!!!
“@jimmykorderas: Reigns wins and goes on to face Brock &amp; announce team talking Wyatt?” SMFH
@WesleyPipes02 stop it, it's not like Roman is Eva Marie out there
“@Boricuaadoll: All the Daniel Bryan fanboys, here's a little advice if you mad. Go look at the picture of Seth Rollins dick. #WWEFastLane”😂
@LaTissaChaNelle I saw it lol
#BelieveTHAT #WWEFastLane
@LaTissaChaNelle LOL I'll check in a bit
@LaTissaChaNelle last week he posted a pic of clippers and said he was gonna do it, I don't know if he did it yet lol
@LaTissaChaNelle he shaved his head, did you know that ? Lol
@DustyFinishPod he did have a concussion early on so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt
@LaTissaChaNelle Fandango 😂
Let's go Roman ! #RomanVsBryan #WWEFastLane
@DustyFinishPod no it's totally due to taker being older than my dad, it wasn't pretty last year lol
@Debo5914Patrick Rusev is the only heel they book properly
Rusev is a made guy now #WWEFastLane
That match was booked perfectly #WWEFastLane
Rusev was crossed eyed for a second there 😂 #WWEFastLane
@DustyFinishPod yeah he's more than  just the streak, all that being said, if Bray loses I'll be super pissed lol
@DustyFinishPod I'm thinking from VKM's perspective and also that torch passing effect went out the window when he lost last year to Brock
@DustyFinishPod they gonna book taker to lose 2 in a row ? This would have been perfect last year
@DustyFinishPod bro I don't wanna see old ass taker again
RT @CurrenSy_Spitta: John Cena= Stan from American dad and Mark Wahlberg combined.
They just showed a kid w/ a Punk shirt on, kick him out ! Lol #WWENXT
Taker/Wyatt should have happened last year w/ Wyatt ending the streak #WWEFastLane
RT @ThisIsNasty: "We're on the Fast Lane to RematchMania, Maggle!" #WWEFastLane
@Boricuaadoll he'll win it at mania
Screw you ref ! #WWEFastLane
I do like BNB a lot as well though

@Boricuaadoll and then she was getting a push a couple of months ago and they squashed it again
#DingDong 😂😂😂 @TCastagna_
@Boricuaadoll I thought she was gonna win it after last mania, but they ended up bringing Paige and it squashed that

@GBean0609 @TwiZZ0_718 they've held it off way longer than I expected
@TwiZZ0_718 but that means Brock has to be at fast lane AND be in a vulnerable state to get possibly cashed in on, can't see that
@TwiZZ0_718 and how/when do they set up his WM match vs Orton ???
@Boricuaadoll I'm sure he is
@TwiZZ0_718 New Day lol
