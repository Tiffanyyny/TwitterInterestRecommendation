For Lent, has given up the following: Beer. Chocolate & fast/junk food. What have I done?
Who knew that blueberries, raspberries, giant chocolate buttons, Green & Blacks Vanilla, along with homemade caramel would go with pancakes?

@lightboxstudios Bless you, for keeping things under your hat!
Doesn't want to talk about anything that has occurred this afternoon. The events will remain between & any future therapist.
Mrs. H has decorating that needs doing. So I'm on my way to St. Mary's. Come on you Rams!

@SDYOHANS I'm pleased that you're well. My photography is going ok. A bit slow, but ok. 5 shoots in the next 2 weeks. 
How's the designing?
@SDYOHANS Fine thanks. How are you?
Is off on a road trip tomorrow. Hampshire to Cornwall & back, all in the same day! 
Might have to find time to stop & buy some clotted cream

Oh how disappointing. Wales should have had a red card, not yellow. Ireland's yellow shouldn't have been. 
Wales still playing for 2nd then.
Well done Tommy Bowe. Forgiven!!!
That was a red card. Nowhere near the ball. 
Touch judge bottled the decision.
Bowe you cock! 
Make amends now!

Maybe the brown bread wasn't to blame. Maybe it was the sandwich maker adding too much cream cheese. But I couldn't possibly comment.
Has discovered that brown bread leaks in the breville! 
White bread from now on.
Actor: can we get this room any warmer? 
Me: yep, don't stand there, with door open. That should help, don't you think?
Photo:  http://t.co/iN2l2eYV
Has turned on the heater in the Green Room & closed the door, so it's warm when the actors break. 
Oh God, what's wrong with me?

Has just tried Mrs H's beef stew, which has been cooking since 9am. He might well have melted into a puddle on the floor. It's fabulous!

Several beers, a large Baileys & now nightnurse. No, I'm not going to snore tonight. Much.
Has been given beer all night, but it must be late enough now, for Baileys. I've got some biscotti to dunk.
*got. 

The beers that good, I can't proof read tweets anymore. 
Except this one, of course.
Never hot the Baileys. Came downstairs to Mrs H holding out a beer for me :-) 
Bless her.
Is it too early for a Baileys?
Has procured some drugs & is now leaving London & heading back to the shire! Nice to see some old friends & meet some new ones though.
Has just realised that he's been here before. 2002 with Rise Rage rehearsals!
Is in a big old rehearsal room. With a heat source as big as the sun!
Had thought about having a drink after his meeting later, but has just eaten a slice of Mrs H's booze addled Christmas cake.

Via the Chinese I hope.
Can't quite believe that he is having a genuinely new experience this afternoon. Who knew drinks were this cheap in the Conservative club?
Might be a little bit drunk. And when I say a little bit .....
Full English with a Gin & Tonic. Breakfast of champions!
Mrs H discovered in the 2nd establishment I visited, but not before a police car flashed by, causing me to think mmmm I wonder....

@skyspun I'm good thanks. Just been busy with work for what seems like ages. What are you up to this weekend?
@skyspun Hey Jess, how are you?
@xAraneaex Possibly. Send me the link. Sx.
Had a blast, retrospectively, shooting Gill & Simon's wedding in beautiful Cranbourne on Fri. Loads of great images. Who else needs a tog?
@xAraneaex Lets do it. One evening, weather permitting, next week. I'm free Tues throu Thurs eves. Somewhere like Stokes Bay? Thoughts???

@CatherineDay does it HAVE to be a self portrait? Could I offer to come & shoot you?
thinks that Galaxy Moments, are in fact, naked Minstrels.
Has exercised his democratic right to vote.
@CatherineDay brain implosion could never be a good thing! I did like the idea of you wearing several PG circular bags as tea patches.
@timminchin really!!!?? John swears he wasn't either. Had you hired Kit from Knightrider?
May be about to tweet a scream off frustration. I work in the arts. This isn't a suprise, but still frustrating.
It's taken two solid days of work, but I suspect that I am beginning to lose my cool with being under resourced with both staff & budget.
@CatherineDay increased consumption might not be the answer. No tea for a couple of days would work. Try tea bags as patches :-)
@CatherineDay perhaps you're becoming immune to the effects if tea!?
Is off to wake his Wife up, so he can say "Happy Anniversary!" before going to work.
Worked all day yesterday. Is working all day today & right through until Friday evening. All 11 hour days! 
Luckily, I like my job.
@xAraneaex that so does not luck any fun at all.

@xAraneaex  Finding me, might be the tricksy bit. I'm sure that you look pretty all the time :-) & anyway, she hasn't got in touch yet......
has overcome a fear. On the train to London saw a very attractive girl, so gave her a card & asked to photograph her. She seemed flattered.
Just about to catch a train to London for a production meeting, but minus a Production Manager. Once more onto the breech ...... Etc, etc.
is going to ignore his own advice & is going out tonight with actors, who don't have to get up tomorrow morning.
Has been disturbed from looking after The Canterbury Tales get in by Nick Clegg's helicopter.

@_SophieEllen make sure that you enjoy it! Welcome, tommorrow, to your 20's

It felt a bit odd not getting off the train.  http://tweetphoto.com/17626372
Well on my way to Leeds. It's too nice a day to be stuck on a train.
