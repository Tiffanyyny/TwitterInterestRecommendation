So proud of all my Irish mates, both there and abroad, fighting for equality!

@Optus Sure would if you’ve got the plan data available.

@andrewfaith I’ll never understand why @Telstra just don’t spend the $ to employ and correctly train enough competent off shore staff.
@andrewfaith And after @Telstra promised to resolve it TODAY! What a joke. I’d change ISPs, don’t put up with their shit customer service!
@rysch Hey! I’m not *that* skanky! :p
For the second time this century, I’m single on VD. I don’t know what all the fuss is about, not having to buy any cards/gifts is awesome!
@andrewfaith, @Telstra just don’t care about their customers. In 2013 their customer service is worse than ever and the SM team are just PR.
@andrewfaith Appalling service by @Telstra! They have a good SM team locally but actual customer service ends there. Glad they’re not my ISP
The #geek in me was excited to attend the Australian launch of @Evernote Business this morning! So many new features being added still.

@VirginAustralia Hi Team, how do I have the boarding pass resent as a SMS with the Passbook URL? Your call centre can’t help.
@dzeaiter Wow! That’s fantastic! Congrats to all!
@EmmaLogie I’m only just catching up on tweets now; he’s so adorable!!!
@MatthewHocter You know I’m a HUGE Ella fan, I’ve got over 900 of her tracks in iTunes.
@smittenshel Loving your new pic!
Had the best day at the beach with @madguygonequite.
I actually dreamt that One Direction had two new members and both were fighting over me. WTF!!!

@EmmaLogie I have the funniest story to tell you on Thu! Dive safe and enjoy the newbie!
You can tell that I’m drunk when I give my number to random girls on the street because they think that I’m a cute fun gay.
@AshleySaturday Agree. I’s a shame because her videos, and even her style, use to be so much better and original.
@dzeaiter So great that you should totes grow one and emulate that image/pose exactly.
@dzeaiter That one is the best!
@dzeaiter That’s so adorable!
@exile2059 I’m obsessed with her latest album, especially Girl At Home. #judgeaway

@TroyThrace My fav is Beauty &amp; the Beast and I have several copies! :)
@dzeaiter I’m still tempted to go back and get one for myself! Ariel has ginger hair like me!
@TroyThrace :) I will at some point. I’ve even started collecting the Disney BDs for both my nieces for when they’re a little older.

@jovanni25 @smittenshel When the drag queen was calling me up I was scared as I was thinking of the kissing competition that time. haha
@jovanni25 @smittenshel I was telling Mel earlier that it was so good to see you drunk there again, brought back so many memories!
@smittenshel @jovanni25 Haha
@smittenshel @jovanni25 I still don’t know how or why, but I have had no signs of a hangover today. Maybe ‘cause I haven’t stopped smiling!
@Ozpook I’m sure it was worth it though right?
@andrewfaith :) 2012 has been one of the best years of my life so far, and it’s still far from over!
Drunk &amp; danced with great mates.
Got invited to a leather party by a drag queen.

After a big night out, and a trashy Oporto breaky, I spent spent today at the beach where it was even warm enough to swim! :) Loving spring!
If @Telstra understood social media, I would have revived a call from them by now. #CustomerService #Fail
@matwhi @ashleysaturday See, and you looked happy. I could have even picked one up yesterday with @Optus had I not pre-ordered w @Telstra.
@AshleySaturday @telstra Spent over 3hs holding, one guy even said he'd look at it and just put me back on the loop to hold for another 50m!
@AshleySaturday I thought @telstra would have better service, clearly that's not the case! Everyone's told me they're too busy to help!
@AshleySaturday @telstra @optus I'm glad to hear that. :) I shouldn't have switched from Optus! Telstra was over $400 more expensive too!
It's been &gt;48hrs and no one from @Telstra has gotten back to me despite 2 staff promising to call back on Fri! Worst customer service ever!
@MrPinkCarpet No, you need to manually arrange each. I know!
@MrPinkCarpet Deal :) I use to think the software thing to but I switched a long one ago and never looked back. A lot easier than you think.
This was #spring in #Sydney today! &lt;3 http://t.co/UelbBXSC
@MrPinkCarpet Haha, that's ok as long as it's Apple hardware; I wont support PC. ;)
@MrPinkCarpet Anytime :)
@brolf_az My pleasure. Great catching up, been way too long!
@GayCarBoys @Telstra was advertising 'twice as much coverage' but that was before @Optus switched on MEL on 15 Sept. Check their sites.
@jasonsbradshaw That's nice!! I think the nifty drive only took the smaller SD cards, that would be a standard size.
@GayCarBoys My advice would be to stay clear of @Telstra. @Optus has a large 4G network and far superior customer support.
@EmmaLogie @telstra They can't even tell me that! I could have picked up one today at the Apple Store Broadway which had no queue.
@EmmaLogie NO! And no one at @Telstra will take ownership of the issue. Worst customer experience of my life; utterly disgusted.

@MrPinkCarpet I was in Sarawak, known as the 'Land of Hornbills' (and headhunters!), the previous year but didn't see one so close up there.
@MrPinkCarpet Yes, and it kept pecking at my hand! It's a hornbill native to Malaysia.
@MrPinkCarpet If he allowed a conscious vote AND supported the bill which JG didn't, he would have gained the support he desperately needed.

@Telstra_news Thanks for the acknowledgement Justin, much appreciated. Look forward to a response/resolution soon.
@gadgegroups The shame! At least swallow your pride for 5min and have a play with the new iPhone at the Apple Store this weekend.
@gadgegroups Have you ordered your iPhone 5 yet btw?
@gadgegroups Ha!
Siri is much better with the English UK setting, the male voice is much nicer.
@MrASellers I spent over 3hrs on hold and spoke to lots of people and no one at Telstra can tell me what's happened to mine.
@MrASellers You're not alone, Telstra messed up my order so I didn't get mine today either. :(
@Telstra Thank you Dingo, that would be great! Have submitted online form with full details and would appreciate a prompt response. Thanks!
@Telstra Yes, &amp; after holding for 2hrs experienced the worse customer service ever with no resolution. Is there someone in AU I can talk to?
@Telstra Thx Greg II, understand delays. Appears that a Telstra error cxxld my iPhone 5 delivery &amp; still hasn't resolved as promised.
@zachhorder I'm glad to hear that. Sadly on this experience the call centre person hasn't been so helpful yet.
