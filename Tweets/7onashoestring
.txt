The Steve Jobs Building took about the same time to build as it does to make a movie. #InsideOutEvent
RT @EnzasBargains: Pixar is all open for the hopes that creators will communicate  and have informal meetings! #InsideOutEvent #pixar

There are 100's of 1000's of drawings from story artists go into each movie. #InsideOutEvent
Actually one of my best! Drawing Anger from #InsideOutEvent :) @ Pixar https://t.co/BW2qAVAWsn
Story board artists make fun of each other through caricatures as part of their creative process in storytelling. #InsideOutEvent
RT @EnzasBargains: First they start creating the different characters...#InsideOutEvent
Concept of film is based on what emotions are doing on inside and how it presents itself outside with Riley. #InsideOutEvent
Everyone on the crew brings their own stories as parents into the workshop to create the story. #InsideOutEvent
RT @formulamom: You're more likely to remember something if it has a strong emotion attached to it. #InsideOutEvent
.@PixarInsideOut's last creative note was made 2 weeks ago Friday. Final touches being added now. #InsideOutEvent
RT @VeraSweeney: Easter eggs!!! Look for figment from Epcot @PixarInsideOut #InsideOutEvent
Director brought in Neurologist and Psychologists in order to understand emotions for @PixarInsideOut #InsideOutEvent
Love how Pete Docter's daughter was an inspiration behind @PixarInsideOut #InsideOutEvent
"We don't choose to feel emotions but we do choose how to deal with it." Director Pete Docter #InsideOutEvent
First draft featured Logic as the lead of the Mind rather than Joy but didn't work as well. #InsideOutEvent
Why does Joy have blue hair similar to Sadness? They correlate at some point.  #InsideOutEvent
Why are Riley's emotions both genders? Mom's female. Dad's all male. Mainly for comedy. #InsideOutEvent
Awe. :) "@VeraSweeney: The family that blogs together @7onashoestring @dodomesticdad #InsideOutEvent http://t.co/rHaHaKrlN6"
Bwahahaha. Ask @dodomesticdad ;) "@chadkirchner: @7onashoestring I‚Äôve never seen you angry, that‚Äôs why! :)" #InsideOutEvent
So apparently anger is not an emotion I "fake" well. #InsideOutEvent https://t.co/fnycwXZvGr
Geometry Light allowed the Lighters to use Joy as a model for lighting. #InsideOutEvent
RT @SBellasWays: The geometry light is NEW technology that made the characters an actual light source #InsideOutEvent
RT @theCouponista: Joy's Geometry Light was specially created for her and almost wasn't ready in time for the film! #InsideOutEvent
RT @EnzasBargains: All the emotions have inner glow lights! #InsideOutEvent
RT @SBellasWays: After learning all about lighting I'm convinced I need a Glam Squad Light Crew to follow me around to make me look good  #‚Ä¶
Joy is so bright that she was shaped with color rather than value. #InsideOutEvent
The saturation changes are subtle but help reinforce story elements. #InsideOutEvent
Desaturation helps distinguish between the 2 worlds of @PixarInsideOut  #InsideOutEvent
Lighting enhances character personality and situation.  #InsideOutEvent
RT @SBellasWays: Adding beautiful dramatic lighting can bring a scene to life #InsideOutEvent

RT @EnzasBargains: The lighting is really important to direct the viewers eyes on where to look? #InsideOutEvent
RT @theCouponista: Lighting enhances mood, atmosphere, and drama in the film #InsideOutEvent
RT @dodomesticdad: After listening to the crew of #InsideOut you can really grasp the attention to detail to what it takes to make a Pixar ‚Ä¶
RT @SBellasWays: With a shot being only a few seconds it's lighting's job to draw the eye to the point if the shot with lighting  #InsideOu‚Ä¶
RT @VeraSweeney: Lighting can direct a viewers eye to the main point of the scene #InsideOutEvent
Dramatic lighting enhances mood, atmosphere and drama. #InsideOutEvent
Light adds depth and allows everything to fall into place spatially. @PixarInsideOut  #InsideOutEvent
Lighter usually takes 1 shot/day to Dir. of Photography with 2 or 3 approved each week. #InsideOutEvent
RT @SBellasWays: Lighting can bring depth and emotion to a scene #InsideOutEvent
The Dream Production scene uses 175 lights! Wow! #InsideOutEvent
RT @tasalinas: Talking lighting in animation. Lighting on the computer is much less muscle than in real life. #InsideOutEvent
RT @VeraSweeney: All lighting is created from scratch - lots of artistic ability needed for animated films #InsideOutEvent
Lighting in a shot can get very complex quickly. @PixarInsideOut #InsideOutEvent

Lighting - Has to create every light and shadow completely from scratch to create a beautiful scene. #InsideOutEvent
Joy, as a light source, was a challenge in the film. @PixarInsideOut #InsideOutEvent

Animators notes can be subtle in changes but they make a large difference in the finished product. #InsideOutEvent
RT @SBellasWays: It's good to have a mirror nearby as an animator so you can see the emotion and translate it  #InsideOutEvent
.@PixarInsideOut took 1.5 yrs in animation with a smaller crew. #InsideOutEvent
RT @SBellasWays: First Pass Blocking is rough. Something you just quickly want to get in front of the director. #InsideOutEvent
RT @teachme2save: They had a crew of about 45 animators (at its peak) working on it for about a year &amp; a half #InsideOutEvent
RT @formulamom: Animation dailies sessions are collaborative in spirit! Hoping to hear the word that a scene is final! #InsideOutEvent
RT @theCouponista: The best ideas win but a good idea can come from anyone #InsideOutEvent
Mind world characters are more "cartoony" and animated than real world characters. @PixarInsideOut #InsideOutEvent
Typically 1 plan for 1 film. But @PixarInsideOut was 2 plans for 1 film. #InsideOutEvent
RT @JustEnza: The camera movement and action was the most intense! #InsideOutEvent
RT @formulamom: In the beginning of the film, Riley is the center of her parents' world. She is staged always in the middle. #InsideOutEvent
RT @VeraSweeney: After the move, she no longer feels this way. the shots change. Another way to visually show a message wo having to say it‚Ä¶

@MommaDJane Right?! I want to run home and slather my kids in sunscreen RIGHT NOW! #OlaySPF #LivingFabulosa #Hispz15
26% of skin cancer cases diagnosed in Hispanics are already at advanced stages. #OlaySPF #LivingFabulosa #Hispz15
Most common type of cancer is Basal Cell Carcinoma. Anything that starts to itch, bleed or grow? See a Dr. #LivingFabulosa #OlaySPF #Hispz15
89% of Latinas have NOT had talks about their skin with a doctor. 43% of them don't wear sunscreen. #OlaySPF #LivingFabulosa #Hispz15
The #1 cause of aging? The sun. Even more than smoking. #LivingFabulosa #OlaySPF #Hispz15
Do you need sunscreen on a cloudy day? In the snow? Yes! At least SPF 15.  #LivingFabulosa #OlaySPF #Hispz15
Hispanics need sunscreen too. The rise of melanoma in Latinos has gone up 20% in recent years. #OlaySPF #LivingFabulosa #Hispz15
Daily morning beauty routine should include applying sunscreen. #OlaySPF #LivingFabulosa #Hispz15
SPF is the amount of time your skin is covered without burning. 15=93% coverage. Re-apply every 2 hrs. #OlaySPF #LivingFabulosa
