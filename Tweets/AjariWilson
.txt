@TechGerbil You sound excited.
Another track I did years ago for a game tool software demonstration. http://soundcloud.com/dark-octave/fantasy-theme-lighting-kit-demo
For anybody who is interested I made this for a game beta a few years ago. http://soundcloud.com/dark-octave/switching-gears-level-1-beta
Hopefully I'll be done with the cut scene images by the weekend so that I can focus on sound effects and music. We're almost there.
@terriblefan_36 Cool, I'll add you.
@RobaatoX I remember this song. I remember sitting through those 3 minute summons every fight and wanting to strangle Squall too.
@terriblefan_36 Yeah, I play SSFIV on Xbox 360. I haven't been able to play it much lately though.
@terriblefan_36 Thanks, I got the poster from Comicon '09 I think. I don't know the guys name, but it's autographed by the producer/director
@terriblefan_36 It's a common mistake that I almost think needs to happen for most of us to gauge what we are capable of as game developers
@RobaatoX Wow!
@RobaatoX Watching this for five minutes has answered so many of my line questions. Now I understand how it's done.
RT @gregerskine: IF LIFE HANDS U LEMONS, PUT THEM IN UR INVENTORY SCREEN. REMEMBER THAT IRON DOOR, THREE ROOMS BACK, WITH THE LEMON SHAP ...
@therealcliffyb Country music?
@Naughty_Dog Hope we can attend the next one. I would have loved to har what you guys were talking about.
@terriblefan_36 @spazchickens lol Thanks terriblefan_36.
@MattRix @cliffski Cliffski speaks the truth.
Colleen is busy making bullshots for Screenshot Saturday. Why is Nono holding the chainsaw gun from Gears of War??
@TechGerbil Gotta go for the pro version though ($300). The cheap version ($50) lacks fundamentals like an eyedropper tool and a lot more.
@RobaatoX Cool. I'm using the pen tool in PS to line. It's ok sometimes. I'm thinking about making a few comics for Nono. Thanks again.
@RobaatoX I'll have to check out Sketchbook. Do you ink in Photoshop? How do you get your lines so perfect?
@RobaatoX Your work looks amazing. Is most of your stuff Photoshop?
@TechGerbil @spazchickens It's a pretty funny show. I didn't think I would like it at first.
@TechGerbil I was thinking about getting it for the filters. I want to do a few comics for Nono, but maybe Photoshop is just as good?
@TechGerbil You ever heard of Manga Studio? It's similar to Photoshop but it has Manga filters and effects.
@spazchickens @TechGerbil You think it's just "OK" then why are you constantly singing the theme song?
Finally close to finishing the final character's animations for Nono and the Cursed Treasure.
