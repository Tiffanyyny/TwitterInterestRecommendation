But if drivers learned to share the road, watch the road, drop their damn cell phones while driving, and not give cyclists the finger....

We will see a lot of beautiful mothers tomorrow.
When we would visit my grandparents, grandpa always asked us to greet grandma first.
When dad was home, mom was always the first to be served with the bigger piece.
While dad was out mom always served her meal last until she saw me and my brothers eat.
The greatest gift for a mother is to have all her children together.
Although my relationship with my mother is not the closest, I still love her dearly and respect her.
Two years ago my grandfather passed away. We got the news as we were taking mom to eat.

@pandora_radio You charge a monthly fee just for the pleasure of skipping songs, yet your selection still sucks.
@pandora_radio How is latin music like Ana Gabriel's have to do with the Reageton genre that you play it continuously in her station?
@pandora_radio If the constant dorky and annoying commercials pay your bills, why still charge the listeners for it?
Hey @pandora_radio when will you learn to better select good music based on the genre desired by the listener?
