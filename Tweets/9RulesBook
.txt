Learn the Music Business, Understand its Politics

The music industry will be better for business once everyone gets off the "college campus" &amp; rich execs stop thriving to be rock stars
Those who take risk rely on their own intuition &amp; takes losses as lessons. Dealer will always have conversation for the risk taker
People who gamble in music biz are those who have too many questions for the dealer until the dealer eventually walks away from the table
Music industry has two types of people: those who take risks &amp; those who gamble..

Street Rules in the Office: The Beginner's Guide to Focus in the Music Biz available on http://t.co/FRrHl8lD now
Industry advice at its finest when psychology meets the corporate music business invaded by ghetto children who got street stripes
Hate when Nelson say that ish too but moral of the story is the business gotta grow that's the Street Rules in the Office is about
As @JBettis420 grow I grow, as @renecastillo00 grow We grow as @los_so3 grow @JayAndino grow that's how it go &amp; Nelson say look my children
Rule 9 is grow &amp; mentor others you got people guarding they cubicles like its Buckingham Palace afraid to teach the young feeling threatened
People saying dumb it down the audience is moving to sheep w/ it well if they look to the business the business is just as sheep
Rule 8 is challenge yourself don't be simple, the generic brand has taken over the business that's why everything seem so cornball
Rule 7 is create your own job cuz without your growth &amp; great ideas the business can't grow why you think hip hop been the same since 06
Is for your family not for industry accolades.. I laugh at people who scream how hard they work &amp; how they don't eat missing their family
This business can't wait to replace you so what you not sleeping for? You better stay in good health &amp; realize the hard work you put in....
Rule 6 Work hard, get sick, get replaced get forgotten is a complete disrespectful chapter to #teamnosleep
Rule 5 chase the industry til you dictate the industry that mean stop being so happy being to be an employee make a difference w/ influence
Have a business purpose if it's a networking business purpose atop attending events just to have your nose in your smart phone
Rule 4 balance what's in front of you &amp; what's around you... Don't go to the MTV Awards just to tweet that you are there
You must double check triple check &amp; never assume that that the sharpies work at the meet &amp; greet cover your ass or get thrown under the bus
Rule 3 is a Industry OG favorite: Assume Nothing cover your ass
Rule 2 is Represent, Represent is the chapter that will separate the serious from the groupies..You represent the department who hired you
Rule 1 just tells you how to "Scarface" you're way into "the building" by using school as a "excuse"
Going to school is by far the EASIEST way to enter "the building"... Anyone caught saying I'll do anything to get on, need to attend school
In Rule 1 Associate Yourself w/ Something Greater than Yourself: I encourage the young exec seeking an job in the business to go to college

Never assume that someone else is going to have their part of the job complete when it's crunch time. Pay attention to detail.

Rule 3
The man or woman left standing, like in the game of musical chairs, is the one who will "get thrown under the bus"

Rule 3: Cover Your Ass
When a problem occurs concerning the project, the act of the music stopping represents the boss who walks in the office

Rule 3
You &amp; your co-workers walk around the chairs that represent the project that you're working on at the time the music is being played
The chair represents your job description &amp; the music being played represents business

Rule 3: Cover Your Ass, Assume Nothing
The friendly children's game of musical chairs represents the best comparison when discussing politics in the industry

Rule 3
Rule 3:
Cover Your Ass is similar to the phrase "watch your back" a term used to a alert a person that a unfair fight is about to occur
The industry has lost too many good people due to poor health

New @50Cent's Mixtape: The Lost Tape http://t.co/FVJSUI9F - download now
Hip hop culture is beyond the club&amp; the haters &amp; anything else the 60 year old executive feels can turn a quick profit
music today is equal to eating a tv dinner for Thanksgiving, then questioning your mother's credentials for making Mac &amp; cheese from scratch
Put more value in your art, the lack of value in music is the reason why you can name 10 hit records from 1996 faster than you can from 2006
The lack of patience, the pursuit of being an opportunist, &amp; the lack of respect for protocol are signs that the artist is an idiot
Some artist just aren't ready for the very success they set out to achieve
In the studio laying down the vocals, Street Rules in the Office
Street Rules in the Office written by the last person they should have taught music business to, @DaveHouseWHW
Street Rules in the Office promotes the rules to the game, the psychology of why execs have to be "haters" of generic culture
So if your link is "worth my two pennies" then sure I'll listen &amp; give you two cents worth of feedback then you call the exec "industry"
How would you feel if I asked you if can "spare some change" but from my twitter account, that's the unsigned artist promoting music
Sending links on twitter is not grinding or promoting it's a Nat swatting session at the park Artist continue to depreciate their own value
Artist who randomly sends out twitter links admits that they don't know their audience or their habits
Have more pride in the very art you say is hot,  why sell your product at a dollar store when Home Depot is trying to distribute you.
Basically you are equivalent to the car when the driver sees a airplane hovering over the interstate, we see you driving but so what
Word to the Wise for any artist unsigned: sending Twitter links of your music is equal to the foolish dog barking at a flock of flying birds

Anyone who is still "Trying" usually still feel that they are unworthy & looking for popular support #WHOOOOSHOUSE
Anyone who is caught "Grinding" usually hasn't seen a raise in Income in years, just more work to keep up for less pay #WHOOOOSHOUSE
"Trying" means your still making an attempt at something that you've allready accomplished #WHOOOOSHOUSE
Grinding means your working hard to Remain in One Place #WHOOOOSHOUSE
Anyone practicing Street Rules in the Office you must eliminate the words "trying" or "grind" completely from your vocabulary #WHOOOOSHOUSE
